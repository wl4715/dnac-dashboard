    The longitude and latitude of the center of your floor plan. If you want
    to change the geolocation data of your floor plan, either the 'center' or
    two adjacent corners (e.g. 'topLeftCorner' and 'bottomLeftCorner') must be
    specified. If 'center' is specified, the floor plan is placed over that
    point with no rotation. If two adjacent corners are specified, the floor
    plan is rotated to line up with the two specified points. The aspect ratio
    of the floor plan's image is preserved regardless of which corners/center
    are specified. (This means if that more than two corners are specified,
    only two corners may be used to preserve the floor plan's aspect ratio.).
    No two points can have the same latitude, longitude pair.
